Project Overview:
	For our project, we created a top-down version of Minecraft/Terraria (albeit with substantially limited features, when compared to those of the actual games themselves). This game creates a procedurally generated world, in which the player may move - walking around, harvesting blocks and (re-)placing them elsewhere.

	Please note: game_drafting.py does NOT code for the current game. It was our prototype, so that you can examine the development of the game. The game itself is encoded in the following files:
		Orthogonal_Terraria.py
		Controller_Module.py
		World_Module.py
		Block_Module.py
		Player_Module.py
		Misc_Module.py
	Testing of various functions occured throughout development, and many of the tests we did are located in files with 'testing' in the name.


Required Python Modules:
	Pygame


To play:
	Run Orthogonal_Terraria.py


Controls:
	The up and down arrow keys move your player forwards and backwards, while the left and right arrow keys rotate the player clockwise and counterclockwise

	Space is the mine button (it eliminates trees) and left-shift is the button to place wood. You can only place as many woods as trees you have mined.
